# Built-in Function

1. print()
 -> print is function which is used to print the statement on the screen.
 -> use can mention the values to print between the parentheses.
 -> we can use this  function to put a blank line on screen. just use this = print()
 -> E.x - print("my name is xyx ") 

2. input()
 -> Input function is use to take input from user.
 -> by default input function take input as a string.
 -> the syntax is input()
 -> E.x -  name = input(" enter your name : ") # this input will be store in name variable.

3. len()
 -> Len function is used to count the number of characters present on string.
 -> Counting start from 1 only
 -> it also count the spaces available within string.
 -> E.x. - print(len("my name is xyz") # it also include space within string.

4. int()
 -> int() is used to convert the type of values into interger form.
 -> as we all know input() takes by default string value to convert that into interger use int()
 -> E.x. name = int(input("enter any number : "))
 -> name = "200"
 -> int(name)
 -> if the passed value does not evaluate as integer value , python will display error.

5. string()
 -> The str() function in Python converts a given value into a string representation.
 -> It's a built-in function that accepts various data types as input, including integers, floats, booleans, and other objects.
 -> The primary purpose of str() is to ensure that different data types can be seamlessly combined or manipulated with strings
 -> num = 123
    string_num = str(num)
    print(string_num)  # Output: "123"
    print(type(string_num)) #Output: <class 'str'>
