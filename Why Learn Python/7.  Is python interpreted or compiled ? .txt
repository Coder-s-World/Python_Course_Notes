----------  Python is interpreted or compiled language ?  ------------------

-> Python is interpreted language this is the statement which is mentioned by most of the developer, but this is not fully correct statement beacuse python program is 
   firstly compiled and then interpreted. 
-> Compilation part is not visible to programmer it is hidden from programmer, this is the reason why programmers believe in "Python is interpretd language".
-> Compilation first convert code into byte code and internally convert by PVM (Python Virtual Machine) according to the underlying platfrom (machine + operating 
   system).
