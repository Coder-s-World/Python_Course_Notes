# For loop

For loop execute block of code for certain number of times.
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, 
a set, or a string).

# range() is used within for loop. 

range(start,stop,step)
In Python, range() is a built-in function that generates a sequence of numbers

start = starting value
stop = stopping value
step = how many steps needed to loop

-> range works only with integer
-> by default value of initialize range() is 0 .
-> The range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers. 
-> It is commonly used within loops to iterate a specific number of times. 
-> The function can accept one, two, or three arguments: 
-> it is immutable
-> in stop value always display like stop value- 1. ex if stop value is 4 then output be like 0 1 2 3

If you just pass one argument then loop will consider it as the stop value.
If you just pass two argument then loop will consider it as the start and stop value.

for var in iterable:
    # statements

Difference b/w loops 

Iteration Basis:
  for: Iterates over a sequence.
  while: Iterates based on a condition.

Iteration Count:
  for: Often used when the number of iterations is known.
  while: Often used when the number of iterations is unknown.

Iteration Management:
  for: Iteration is automatically managed.
  while: Requires manual condition updates.

Typical Use:
  for: Processing collections (lists, etc.).
  while: Repeating code until a condition changes.

Infinite Loop Risk:
  for: Lower risk.
  while: Higher risk if the condition isn't properly managed.
